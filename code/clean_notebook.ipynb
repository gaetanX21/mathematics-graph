    "#### 1. The graph of mathematical theories and how they relate to each other\n",
    "We wanted to build a graph that would represent the interactions between mathematical subtheories. We were expecting to see some huge theories like algebra or analysis dominate and have many nodes pointing towards them through the SUBTHEORY_OF relationship, and these nodes would be intermediary theories, themselves pointed towards by even smaller theories, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First approach\n",
    "Our first approach was to simply take our CSV file containing the SUBTHEORY_OF (directed) edges and loading it straight up into Gephi.\n",
    "Note that our graph's family tree structure makes it unfit for certain graph algorithms, such as PageRank or betweenness centrality. We did attempt running these algorithms and obtained poor results as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being quite basic in its construction, running modularity inference on our graph proved quite successful, as the visualization below showcase. However, it was not able to cluster theories into large domains like algebra and instead created smaller clusters, like computational mathematics. We thus have 63 communities and a modularity score of 0.477, which is average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, graph density is very low (0.008) and we have a few lone nodes, which correspond to niche mathematical theories such as systolic hyperbolic geometry, stratified morse theory, bolyai-lobachevskian geometry, etc.\n",

    "<img src=\"../graphs/theory_theory_naive/fruchterman_reingold.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second approach\n",
    "We felt like this first approach was a bit naive and that we could do better. We thus created another graph, with the same Theory nodes but this time weighting the edges t1->t2 with the number of mathematicians who had contributed to both theories t1 and t2. We achieved this using the following CYPHER query:\n",
    "<pre style=\"font-family: monospace\">\n",
    "MATCH (t1:Theory), (t2:Theory), (m:Mathematician) WHERE (m)-[:CONTRIBUTED_TO]->(t1) AND (m)-[:CONTRIBUTED_TO]->(t2) AND t1.name<>t2.name RETURN t1.name AS Source, t2.name AS Target, COUNT(DISTINCT(m)) as Weight\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Overall modularity is 0.136, which is rather low as expected because mathematics are not clustered : all domains are linked one way or another. However we were quite surprised to find combinatorics along algebra, analysis and geometry, which are much larger domains. We thought it was some sort of algorithmical artifact and we tweaked the modularity algorithm slightly (using a resolution of 1.05 instead of 1) so as to end up with only 3 classes. This time combinatorics disappeared and we ended up with the algebra/analysis/geometry triad, as hoped!\n",

    "1. the modularity algorithm was able to cluster mathematicians into lineages where a mathematician's parent is its doctoral advisor\n",

    "3. some lineages (he ones on the borders of the circle) seem to be independent ; this could be due to a lack of data (i.e. we're missing some edges) or to the fact that some mathematical communities are most closed than others (e.g. the Japanese for a long time)\n",

    "Another interesting metric with such a graph is eccentricity, which is defined as the distance from a given starting node to the farthest node from it in the network. Since edges are directional, a node's eccentricity is simply the length of its lineage, starting from itself. The eccentricity histogram below shows that most mathematicians have no doctoral students or just one. This is probably because few mathematicians actually have more than one doctoral student. However it's a bit surprising that most mathematicians have no doctoral students at all. Our hypothesis is that most do have one or more doctoral students, but they are not famous enough and therefore do not appear on the graph as they do not exist on Wikidata.\n",

We also see that some very famous mathematicians are actually \"grandparents\" of other very famous mathematicians through the doctoral student/advisor link. In that regard, Gauss is Felix Klein's great grandfather, and Klein himself is David Hilbert's grandfather!\n",
    "\n",
