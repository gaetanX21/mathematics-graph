# Mathematics' graph
In this report, we present a knowledge graph of mathematics which we built from scratch using both Wikidata and Wikipedia. It must not be understood as a graph of actionable mathematical knowledge to be queried but rather as a graph of historical knowledge about mathematics, seeking to answer general questions such as how mathematicians are linked to each other, how theories are structured, and what links exist between mathematicians and their theories.

The PDF has everything you need to know about the graph: a brief description, an explanation of construction, and finally analysis & visualization.

The notebook contains all the code used to retrieve the data, build the graph and analyze it. Two additional Python scripts were used to scrap Wikipedia.
